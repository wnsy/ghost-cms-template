# ghost-cms-template

I use HTML5 Boilerplate framework and use it as a base to create a HTML and CSS files before converting those files for 
Ghost CMS template using Handlebars.js
For now, it's semi-responsive when the browser is being resized. I haven't decided how the navigation bars are going to be put either use JS like the default template for Ghost CMS or just put them as a top bar navigation.
